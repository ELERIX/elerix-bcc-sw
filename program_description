When the program starts, it reads the config file (it must be in the same folder), creates one file (also in the same folder) for every IP adress that is in config and tries to connect to all IP adresses that it found in the file. If there are not written any IP adress, or if it cannot connect to any IP adress that it had read, then it will print error message on the screen and aften the user press enter, it will shut itself off. If there is at least one adress that it can connect to, it will start downloading data from it with period that is defined in config file. Every midnight (the program uses system time) the program sends email (if it is able to do so) and checks if file_length "ran out". If it does, than all files will be closed and new ones will be created. If the voltage of the batteries reach any limit, the program will try to send email.
